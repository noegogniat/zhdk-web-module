      <h1>Clever birds of prey</h1>
      <p>
        The common buzzard is a typical Buteo in much of its behaviour. It is
        most often seen either soaring at varying heights or perched prominently
        on tree tops, bare branches, telegraph poles, fence posts, rocks or
        ledges, or alternately well inside tree canopies.
